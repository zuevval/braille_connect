The abbreviated words and phrases condensed the passage, making it more accessible. This practice is also employed in braille. Braille utilizes a system of contracted or abbreviated letter combinations to enhance reading speed and efficiency. This form is known as contracted braille or grade 2 braille. Uncontracted braille or grade 1 braille refers to letters or words that are not abbreviated. The terminology is unrelated to academic grades.

Alphabetic Wordsigns

In braille, certain words are represented by a single alphabet letter, simplified for contraction. There are 23 Alphabetic Wordsigns, following the Stand Alone Rule (where 'a,' 'i,' and 'o' already have independent meanings).

Stand Alone Rule:

When a single letter stands alone with an empty space before and after it, we read it in its contracted form (grade 2), and it conveys an entire word meaning.

Example: "you can do it" becomes "y c d x"

As follows: y c d x

UNIT 3 STRONG CONTRACTIONS (AND, FOR, OF, THE, WITH), CAPITAL AND ENDING PUNCTUATION

3A. INTENSIVE CONTRACTIONS (AND, FOR, OF, THE, WITH)

In the realm of braille, five specific groups of letters are denoted by distinct braille patterns or symbols.

These symbols serve a dual purpose. They can function independently, representing an entire word (referred to as a wordsign). Alternatively, they can be integrated into a word, symbolizing the group of letters corresponding to the symbol (termed a groupsign).

and     for     of     the    with
⠯       ⠿       ⠷      ⠮       ⠾

Examples:

They can be employed as complete words.

the    dogs      go    for     rides     with  people
⠮     ⠙⠕⠛⠎     ⠛     ⠿     ⠗⠊⠙⠑⠎     ⠾     ⠏
and   have   lots      of     fun
⠯     ⠓     ⠇⠕⠞⠎     ⠷     ⠋⠥⠝

They can also be utilized as components within a word.

randy     foregoes     therapy    and    withdraws
⠗⠯⠽     ⠿⠑⠛⠕⠑⠎     ⠮⠗⠁⠏⠽     ⠯     ⠾⠙⠗⠁⠺⠎

Other Partial Word Examples:

⠓⠯     ⠿⠍     ⠷⠋     ⠮⠝     ⠾⠙⠗⠑⠺

3B. CAPITALIZATION AND TERMINAL PUNCTUATION
Capital Letter   Capital Word   Period    Question Mark    Exclamation Point
        ⠠           ⠠⠠            ⠲            ⠦                      ⠖

Capitalization:
Indicator for a capital letter: ⠠

The capital letter indicator, or capital sign (dot 6), is positioned before a word or letter to denote it as a capital.

Example:
  Dan      Brady

⠠⠙⠁⠝⠀  ⠠⠃⠗⠁⠙⠽

Indicator for a capital word: ⠠⠠

To capitalize an entire word, a capital word indicator (dot 6)(dot 6) is placed in front of the word.

Example:
   BIG      SALE

⠠⠠⠃⠊⠛⠀  ⠠⠠⠎⠁⠇⠑

Ending Punctuation:
Ending punctuation is linked to a word or letter, just as in print. One space is left between a punctuation mark and the beginning of the next sentence.

Period: ⠲

Example:
 The   quiz  is   next   week.

⠠⠮⠀ ⠟⠥⠊⠵⠀ ⠊⠎⠀ ⠝⠑⠭⠞⠀⠺⠑⠑⠅⠲

Question mark: ⠦

Example:
Can   I   have  a  hot  dog ?

⠠⠉⠀ ⠠⠊⠀  ⠓ ⠀⠁⠀ ⠓⠕⠞⠀⠙⠕⠛⠦

Exclamation point: ⠖

Example:
  Wow!   The  score   is  tied!

⠠⠺⠕⠺⠖⠀⠠⠮⠀ ⠎⠉⠕⠗⠑⠀⠊⠎⠀⠞⠊⠑⠙⠖

Example:
HEY! Can you wait?

My feet hurt.

cap. word hey   excl. pt.    cap. can  you  wait   ?
⠠⠠ ⠓⠑⠽             ⠖       ⠠    ⠉   ⠽   ⠺⠁⠊⠞  ⠦
cap. my  feet    hurt .
⠠ ⠍⠽   ⠋⠑⠑⠞  ⠓⠥⠗⠞ ⠲

UNIT 4 SYMBOLS FOR OPERATIONS AND COMPARISONS

The subsequent symbols are crafted using two cells. The initial cell is referred to as a prefix (typically comprised of dots 4, 5, and 6, as they are not used as letters).

These symbols for operations and comparisons are employed with numbers, just as they are in print.

OPERATION SYMBOLS
These operation symbols are created using the dot 5 prefix, and no space is left between the operation symbol and the numbers.

Plus (+) ⠐⠖
Minus (-) ⠐⠤
Multiplication (x) ⠐⠦
Multiplication dot (∙) ⠐⠲
Divided by (÷) ⠐⠌

Examples:
 5   +   6

⠼⠑ ⠐⠖  ⠼⠋

10    -    2

⠼⠁⠚ ⠐⠤   ⠼⠃

100    x    52

⠼⠁⠚⠚ ⠐⠦  ⠼⠑⠃

   7   ∙  8

⠀⠼⠛ ⠐⠲  ⠼⠓

25    ÷   5

⠼⠃⠑ ⠐⠌  ⠼⠑


COMPARISON SYMBOLS
These comparison symbols are formed using either the dot 4 prefix (for < and >) or the dot 5 prefix (for =). Unlike the previous operation symbols, a blank space is left before and after the 2-cell symbol.

Equals (=) ⠐⠶
Less than (<) ⠈⠣
Greater than (>) ⠈⠜

Examples:

10     =   5    +   4
⠼⠁⠚⠀⠐⠶⠀ ⠼⠑  ⠐⠖  ⠼⠙


24    ∙   8    =
⠼⠃⠙ ⠐⠲  ⠼⠓⠀⠐⠶

33    ÷    3   =   11

⠼⠉⠉ ⠐⠌  ⠼⠉⠀⠐⠶⠀ ⠼⠁⠁

True   or   false   6   x   6    <  38

⠞⠗⠥⠑⠀⠕⠗⠀⠋⠁⠇⠎⠑⠀⠼⠋ ⠐⠦  ⠼⠋⠀⠈⠣⠀ ⠼⠉⠓

a  +   3   >  7

⠁ ⠐⠖ ⠼⠉⠀⠈⠜⠀⠼⠛

Tally Marks
Tally Mark ( ||||| ) ⠸
Strikethrough ⠒

A tally mark is depicted by a vertical line (dots 4-5-6). Sets of tally marks consist of 5 tally marks followed by a space, but they can also be represented as 4 tally marks followed by a strikethrough (dots 2-5) and then a space, forming a "five-bar gate."

Examples:
 |||||   |||
⠸⠸⠸⠸⠸⠀⠸⠸⠸

 ||||    ||||    ||

⠸⠸⠸⠸⠒⠀⠸⠸⠸⠸⠒⠀⠸⠸
