The abbreviated words and phrases condensed the passage, making it more accessible. This practice is also employed in braille. Braille utilizes a system of contracted or abbreviated letter combinations to enhance reading speed and efficiency. This form is known as contracted braille or grade 2 braille. Uncontracted braille or grade 1 braille refers to letters or words that are not abbreviated. The terminology is unrelated to academic grades.

Alphabetic Wordsigns

In braille, certain words are represented by a single alphabet letter, simplified for contraction. There are 23 Alphabetic Wordsigns, following the Stand Alone Rule (where 'a,' 'i,' and 'o' already have independent meanings).

Stand Alone Rule:

When a single letter stands alone with an empty space before and after it, we read it in its contracted form (grade 2), and it conveys an entire word meaning.

Example: "you can do it" becomes "y c d x"

As follows: y c d x
