UNIT 2 ALPHABETIC WORDSIGNS

The abbreviated words and phrases condensed the passage, making it more accessible. This practice is also employed in braille. Braille utilizes a system of contracted or abbreviated letter combinations to enhance reading speed and efficiency. This form is known as contracted braille or grade 2 braille. Uncontracted braille or grade 1 braille refers to letters or words that are not abbreviated. The terminology is unrelated to academic grades.

Alphabetic Wordsigns

In braille, certain words are represented by a single alphabet letter, simplified for contraction. There are 23 Alphabetic Wordsigns, following the Stand Alone Rule (where 'a,' 'i,' and 'o' already have independent meanings).

Stand Alone Rule:

When a single letter stands alone with an empty space before and after it, we read it in its contracted form (grade 2), and it conveys an entire word meaning.

Example: "you can do it" becomes "y c d x"

As follows: y c d x

UNIT 3 STRONG CONTRACTIONS (AND, FOR, OF, THE, WITH), CAPITAL AND ENDING PUNCTUATION

3A. INTENSIVE CONTRACTIONS (AND, FOR, OF, THE, WITH)

In the realm of braille, five specific groups of letters are denoted by distinct braille patterns or symbols.

These symbols serve a dual purpose. They can function independently, representing an entire word (referred to as a wordsign). Alternatively, they can be integrated into a word, symbolizing the group of letters corresponding to the symbol (termed a groupsign).

Examples:

They can be employed as complete words.

⠮     ⠙⠕⠛⠎     ⠛     ⠿     ⠗⠊⠙⠑⠎     ⠾     ⠏

They can also be utilized as components within a word.

Capitalization:
Indicator for a capital letter: ⠠

The capital letter indicator, or capital sign (dot 6), is positioned before a word or letter to denote it as a capital.

Example:
  Dan   ⠠⠙⠁⠝⠀   
  Brady  ⠠⠃⠗⠁⠙⠽

Indicator for a capital word: ⠠⠠

To capitalize an entire word, a capital word indicator (dot 6)(dot 6) is placed in front of the word.

Example:
  BIG ⠠⠠⠃⠊⠛⠀
  SALE ⠠⠠⠎⠁⠇⠑

Ending Punctuation:
Ending punctuation is linked to a word or letter, just as in print. One space is left between a punctuation mark and the beginning of the next sentence.


Period: ⠲

Example:
 The   quiz  is   next   week.

UNIT 4 MATH SIGNS OF OPERATION AND COMPARISON

4A. SYMBOLS FOR OPERATIONS AND COMPARISONS

The subsequent symbols are crafted using two cells. The initial cell is referred to as a prefix (typically comprised of dots 4, 5, and 6, as they are not used as letters).

These symbols for operations and comparisons are employed with numbers, just as they are in print.

OPERATION SYMBOLS
These operation symbols are created using the dot 5 prefix, and no space is left between the operation symbol and the numbers.

Plus (+) ⠐⠖
Minus (-) ⠐⠤
Multiplication (x) ⠐⠦
Multiplication dot (∙) ⠐⠲
Divided by (÷) ⠐⠌

Examples:

5+6 ⠼⠑⠐⠖⠼⠋⠀
10-2 ⠼⠁⠚⠐⠤⠼⠃⠀
100x52 ⠼⠁⠚⠚⠐⠦⠼⠑⠃⠀
7∙8 ⠀⠼⠛⠐⠲⠼⠓⠀
25÷5 ⠼⠃⠑⠐⠌⠼⠑⠀


COMPARISON SYMBOLS
These comparison symbols are formed using either the dot 4 prefix (for < and >) or the dot 5 prefix (for =). Unlike the previous operation symbols, a blank space is left before and after the 2-cell symbol.

Equals (=) ⠐⠶
Less than (<) ⠈⠣
Greater than (>) ⠈⠜

Examples:

10=5+4  ⠼⠁⠚⠀⠐⠶⠀⠼⠑⠐⠖⠼⠙⠀

Tally Marks
Tally Mark ( ||||| ) ⠸
Strikethrough ⠒

A tally mark is depicted by a vertical line (dots 4-5-6). Sets of tally marks consist of 5 tally marks followed by a space, but they can also be represented as 4 tally marks followed by a strikethrough (dots 2-5) and then a space, forming a "five-bar gate."

Examples:
 |||||   |||  ⠸⠸⠸⠸⠸⠀⠸⠸⠸

 ||||    ||||    ||  ⠸⠸⠸⠸⠒⠀⠸⠸⠸⠸⠒⠀⠸⠸

--------------------------------------

UNIT 5  SINGLE CELL PUNCTUATION AND SHORTFORM WORDS

5A. MORE SINGLE CELL PUNCTUATION

You've already acquired knowledge about ending punctuation marks (period, question mark, and exclamation point).

The subsequent single-cell punctuation signs are employed similarly to how they are used in print and adhere to the conventional print spacing.

Comma (,) ⠂
Apostrophe (') ⠄
Opening Quotation Marks (") ⠦
Closing Quotation Marks (") ⠴
Semicolon (;) ⠆
Colon (:) ⠒
Hyphen (-) ⠤
Ellipsis (3 periods) ⠲⠲⠲

Note: The opening quotation mark resembles the question mark, but the difference lies in the fact that the opening quotation mark never appears at the end of a word, and the question mark never appears at the beginning of a word.

Examples:

Comma
The  mural    is  crimson,    beige,  and   blue.

5B. SHORTFORM WORDS (FIRST TWO LETTERS) 

Shortform words or abbreviated words do not necessitate any distinct braille symbol; they are straightforwardly condensed forms of common words achieved by excluding vowels or other segments of the word. Most of them can be pronounced using common sense.

There is a total of 75 abbreviated words.

Guidelines:

Abbreviated words can serve as both complete words and partial words.
Usage as partial words is permissible for both compound and segmented words.
They can also be applied to proper names, provided the abbreviated word encompasses the entire proper name.
Avoid using an abbreviated word if it might lead to confusion in pronunciation.

Shortform Words (Initial Two Letters)
This set of shortform words or abbreviated words utilizes the initial two letters of the word it signifies.

Word    Abbreviation Braille

according   ac          ⠁⠉

friend      fr          ⠋⠗
little *    ll          ⠇⠇
NOTE: Notice that little is an exception and uses two ls instead of the initial two letters.

Examples:
I will call my friend again after a little bit.

I   will call   my   fr   ag   af  a  ll  bit.

UNIT 6 STRONG GROUPSIGNS (CH, SH, TH, WH, OU, ST), WORDSIGNS AND SHORTFORM WORDS

6A. STRONG GROUPSIGNS AND WORDSIGNS (CH, SH, TH, WH, OU, ST)

The following 2-letter combinations are represented in braille by a one-cell braille shape.

ch	sh	th	wh	ou	st
⠡	⠩	⠹	⠱	⠳	⠌


Strong Groupsigns
When these braille shapes are used as part of a word, they are called groupsigns. They may be used in any part of a word for the letters they represent.

Example of words containing these strong groupsigns:

cheese	  hush	  teeth	  whale	  pour	  waste
⠡⠑⠑⠎⠑	  ⠓⠥⠩	  ⠞⠑⠑⠹	  ⠱⠁⠇⠑	  ⠏⠳⠗	  ⠺⠁⠌⠑
Example of words with multiple strong groupsigns:

(ch)ur(ch)	(sh)(ou)t	(th)ra(sh)	(wh)ite	    (ou)(ch)	(wh)i(st)le
  ⠡⠥⠗⠡	             ⠩⠳⠞	   ⠹⠗⠁⠩	 ⠱⠊⠞⠑	       ⠳⠡	⠱⠊⠌⠇⠑


Strong Wordsigns
When these same groupsigns stand alone with an empty space before and behind, they represent a whole word.

These wordsigns represent the following words:

child	shall	this	which	out	still
⠡	⠩	⠹	⠱	⠳	⠌


Example of sentences containing these 2-letter whole-word contractions:

This	child	still	wants	 to	go	out	.
⠠⠹	⠡	⠌	⠺⠁⠝⠞⠎	 ⠞⠕	⠛	⠳	⠲


Which	color	shall	I	pick	?
⠠⠱	⠉⠕⠇⠕⠗	  ⠩	⠠⠊	⠏⠊⠉⠅	⠦

Shortform Words (First Letter/Last Letter)
Shortform words do not require any special braille symbol. They are simply shortened forms of common words.

Guidelines:

Shortform words can be used as both whole-word and part-words.

Part-word usage is permitted for both compound and divided words.

They can also be used for proper names, as long as the short-form word represents the entire proper name.

Avoid using a shortform word if it would cause confusion in pronunciation.


6B. SHORTFORM WORDS (FIRST LETTER/LAST LETTER)

This group of shortform words uses the first and last letter or symbol of the word it represents.
