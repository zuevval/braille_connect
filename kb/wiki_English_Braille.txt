English Braille, or Grade 2 Braille, is the braille alphabet employed for English.
This form of Braille has around 250 components inclusive of letters (phonograms), numerals, punctuation, formatting marks, contractions, and abbreviations (logograms).
Some English Braille letters, like ⠡ ⟨ch⟩, match up with more than one printed letter.

English Braille has three levels of complexity: Grade 1, Grade 2, and "Grade 3".
Grade 1 is nearly a direct transcription of printed English and is limited to basic literacy.
Grade 2, which is widely used beyond basic literacy materials, does not follow a one-to-one transcription system completely (for instance, the letter ⠡ ⟨ch⟩) and incorporates numerous abbreviations and contractions.
Both Grade 1 and Grade 2 are standardized.
"Grade 3" is a variety of personal shorthands, rarely zaappearing in publications.

HISTORY

Braille was introduced to Britain in 1861.
A French-based system, with a few hundred English contractions and abbreviations, was accepted as the predominant script in Great Britain in 1876.
Due to inadequacies in the contractions and abbreviations, the current grade-2 system known as Revised Braille, was adopted in the British Commonwealth in 1902.
In 1878, based on the principle of all braille alphabets following the original French alphabetic arrangement, this principle was adopted by Britain, Germany and Egypt (see International Braille).
During this period in the United States, three scripts were in use: non-braille New York Point; American Braille, reorganized to put the most used letters with the least dots first; and a variation of English Braille, reordered following the English alphabet, giving the letters wxyz the values allotted to xyzç in France and England.
Semi-contracted English Braille, Grade 1+1⁄2, was approved in Britain in 1918, and fully contracted Grade 2 in 1932, with few accommodations for the Americans.
These adaptations included swapping the British two-dot capital sign with the one-dot emphasis sign, commonly left out anyway, eliminating several religious contractions from general use, and establishing a rule that contractions and abbreviations should not span 'major' syllabic boundaries.

In 1991, a proposal for Unified English Braille was made in the United States, aiming to resolve confusion arising from competing standards for academic uses of English Braille.
After numerous design modifications, it was adopted by Commonwealth countries starting in 2005 and by the United States, commencing gradual implementation post-2012.
The main deviations from Revised Braille are found in punctuation, symbols, and formatting, better exemplifying print conventions in areas like brackets, mathematical notation, and typefaces.

SYSTEM

The 64 braille patterns are organized into decades based on their numerical order.
The first decade consists of the numerals 1 to 0, using only the top and mid row of the cell.
The 2nd to 4th decades stem from the first decade by incorporating dots to the bottom row.
The 5th decade is created by shifting the first decade downwards.
For each decade, there are two extra mirror-image patterns.
Additionally, there are three patterns that use only the bottom row of the cell.
The final pattern is an empty cell, used as a space and possesses the same width as the other patterns.

Cells numbered 1 through 25, along with 40 (w), correspond to the 26 letters of the basic Latin alphabet.
The remaining 37 cells are typically used for punctuation and are typically assigned varying values across different languages.

ALPHABET

The English Braille alphabet has letters that correspond directly to the 26 letters of the English print alphabet plus ligatures that are equivalent to digraphs and sequences in print.
Certain ligatures represent widespread words such as 'and' or 'of', but they do not stand for actual words in the conventional sense: pronunciation and meaning aren't relevant, only spelling matters.
For instance, the braille symbol ⠮ ⟨the⟩ is utilized frequently whenever the sequence of printed letters 'the' appears, not exclusively for the word "the".
To elaborate, ⠮ ⟨the⟩ functions as the letter "the" in braille, as observed in the two-letter word ⠮⠝ then (the-n).
Likewise, the word 'hand' is broken down into h-and, 'roof' (which phonetically doesn't resemble "of" at all) is spelled as r-o-of, and 'forest' is spelled with just three letters in braille, ⠿⠑⠌ for-e-st.
Such a concept applies to numbers as well—'7th' is written as ⠼⠛⠹ #-7-th where English in print closely matches standard braille syntax. There exist various conventions determining when a sequence in print is "contracted" in this manner in braille, and when it is completely spelled out.

Braille code for numbers:

Number indicator: dots 3, 4, 5, 6 (⠼)
1: dot 1 (⠁)
2: dots 1, 2 (⠃)
3: dots 1, 4 (⠉)
4: dots 1, 4, 5 (⠙)
5: dots 1, 5 (⠑)
6: dots 1, 2, 4 (⠋)
7: dots 1, 2, 4, 5 (⠛)
8: dots 1, 2, 5 (⠓)
9: dots 2, 4 (⠊)
0: dots 2, 4, 5 (⠚)

Note: To differentiate braille numbers from letter symbols A to J, a number sign should precede braille numbers.
Note: When numbers are directly followed by letters, a letter sign or grade 1 indicator (⠰) is necessary to separate them.

Comma (,): dot 2 (⠂)
Semicolon (;): dots 2, 3 (⠆)
Colon (:): dots 2, 5 (⠒)
